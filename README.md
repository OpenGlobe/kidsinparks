Schedule
---

We'll work together to develop designs and / or prototypes that address three key opportunities related to granting, accepting and revoking admission to parks for 4th graders. The hackathon will follow a modified Agile framework, with pitch sessions throughout the iterative review process.  The hackathon will investigate technology solutions for three types of users: youth - including those coming from disadvantaged backgrounds, employees that grant entrance to parks, teachers and parents.  (Coming soon: user strries!)
